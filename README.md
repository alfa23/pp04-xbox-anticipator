# **UCD Phase 1: STRATEGY** 

## **PROJECT GOALS**

**title** aims to... 

## **USER GOALS:** 

*Unregistered User (Logged Out) Goals* include:
- 
- 
- 

*Registered User (Logged In) Goals* include:
- 
- 
- 

*Site Admin (Superuser) Goals* include:
- 
- 

## **USER EXPECTATIONS:**

- Intuitive/conventional navigation elements
- Familiar and/or easily understandable site structure
- Responsive: access site easily on any device


## **USER STORIES:**

A **GitHub** classic kanban project board was utilised throughout to log all User Stories, track their progress and manage the project. This helped keep focus by moving them, in manageable batches, through *lanes*; from "to do" through "in progress" into "done", as they were completed.

# **UCD Phase 2: SCOPE**

### Analysis and grading of *Phase One considerations* allows a simple ***Strategy Table*** to be generated:

| OPPORTUNITY/PROBLEM/FEATURE                | IMPORTANCE | VIABILITY/FEASIBILITY | ID    | 
|--------------------------------------------|:----------:|:---------------------:|:-------
| OPPORTUNITY/PROBLEM/FEATURE                | 5          | 5                     | A     |
| OPPORTUNITY/PROBLEM/FEATURE                | 5          | 5                     | B     |
| OPPORTUNITY/PROBLEM/FEATURE                | 5          | 5                     | C     |
| OPPORTUNITY/PROBLEM/FEATURE                | 5          | 5                     | D     |
| OPPORTUNITY/PROBLEM/FEATURE                | 5          | 5                     | E     |
| OPPORTUNITY/PROBLEM/FEATURE                | 5          | 5                     | F     |
| OPPORTUNITY/PROBLEM/FEATURE                | 5          | 5                     | G     |
| TOTAL                                      | 35         | 35                    |       |

## **STRATEGIC TRADE-OFFS**

Plotting the Strategy Table results provides a visible indication of what is feasibily within the scope of the project at this time. As I am unable to meet all requirements at present, I will aim to provide **Title** initially as an MVP or Minimum Viable Product, therefore, due to time and current-skill limitations the site will be developed in phases:

  ***Initial Phase:*** Delivery of MVP, a fully functioning website, with the exception of
    
  - 
  
  - 

  ***Secondary Phase:***

## **LANGUAGES**

- [**JavaScript**](https://www.javascript.com/) was used to add interactivity and enrich the User eXperience

- [**HTML5**](https://html.com/html5/) (HyperText Markup Language) was used for structuring & presenting site content

- [**CSS**](https://www.css3.info/) (Cascading Style Sheets) was used to provide styling to the HTML

## **TOOLS**

  ![favicon](readme_media/site_screens/pp02_favicon.png)

- [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/) was used for version control (commit to Git and push to GitHub)

- [**Gitpod**](https://www.gitpod.io/) was used to write my code; an online IDE linked to the GitHub repository

- [**GitHub**](https://github.com/) was used to create the repository and store the project's code after being pushed from Git

- [**Chrome**](https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/) used to debug & test source code using HTML5 and to test site responsiveness

- [**Balsamiq**](https://balsamiq.com) used to generate project site maps and wireframes

## ***FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT***

- Identified as **Strategic Trade-offs** at ***UXD Phase 2***, a **GOAL** and **GOAL** will be addressed, skills and time permitting, as and when possible.

----

# **VERSION CONTROL**

Managed within **GitHub** and **Gitpod** via regular commits pushed to GitHub remote servers:

## Gitpod Workspaces
1. Starting from GitHub, clone the Code Institute template by clicking Use This Template and copying to my repo. Launch Workspace by clicking GitPod button - this action is only performed once and the workspace is subsequently reopened through GitPod.

2. Start the Gitpod Workspace which opens an online IDE editor window.
    
    - Update GitHub by committing from GitPod

3. During editing save the code regularly, using git add ., git commit -m "commit message here" and git push Bash commands to push changes to the GitHub repository.

4. Meaningful commit messages allow easy roll-back of any changes to earlier versions.

# **TESTING**

## AUTOMATED TESTING

## jshint Validator Testing 

- JavaScript
  - No errors were returned when passing through the [JSHint validator](https://jshint.com/)

![JSHint JS](readme_media/check_screens/)

## W3C Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the [(X)HTML5 Validator](https://html5.validator.nu/)

![W3C HTML](readme_media/check_screens/)

- HTML
  - 3 errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org)
    - These relate to the outdated convention of only *ever* using one `<main>` tag

![W3C HTML](readme_media/check_screens/)

- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org)

![W3C CSS](readme_media/check_screens/)

**Google Developer Tools**

- I made use of the built-in **Chrome Dev Tools** to experiment and debug while coding, in addition to testing simulated responsive behaviour across a wide range of mobile and desktop devices, and finally checking all pages Performance using **Lighthouse**. 

**Response Testing**

In order to make sure that RJW Illustration was responsive to all device sizes, I used [amiresponsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/)

![amiresponsive](readme_media/check_screens/)

**WebPageTest**

- I used [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/) set to London/Chrome as a final test for **Title**.

![WebPageTest Main](readme_media/check_screens/)
